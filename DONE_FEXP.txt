///// NDCQUEST: for explicit scheme, what is the argument that allows us to treat phistar[it+1] explicitly ?
In fields_implicit::advance_implicit for explicit algo, corrected bug where expflowopt was not reset to enable the normal antot to be computed.
Moved setting of expflowopt to expflowopt_felix from getfield to advance_implicit.
